#  Revealing the Detailed Lineage of Script Outputs using Hybrid Provenance

The dccpaper bundle consists of two very similar classes.

ijdc-v9.cls corresponds to the template used by the [International
Journal of Digital Curation], beginning with volume 9.

idcc.cls corresponds to the template used for the [International Digital
Curation Conference], beginning with IDCC15.

As the classes are so similar, their common features are abstracted out
into dccpaper-base.sty; please do not attempt to use this package
independently of the above classes.

The classes are suitable for submissions to the respective review
boards, but can also be used to produce the final camera-ready papers.

## Installation

### Managed way

The latest stable release of the dccpaper bundle has been packaged for
TeX Live and MiKTeX. If you are running TeX Live and have `tlmgr`
installed, you can install the bundle simply by running
`tlmgr install dccpaper`. If you are running MiKTeX, you can install the
bundle by running `mpm --install=dccpaper`. Both `tlmgr` and `mpm` have
GUI versions that you might find friendlier.

### Automated way

A makefile is provided which you can use with the Make utility:

  * Running `make` generates the derived files
      - README.md
      - dccpaper.pdf
      - ijdc-v9.cls
      - idcc.cls
      - dccpaper-base.sty
      - dccpaper-apacite.bib
      - dccpaper-biblatex.bib
  * Running `make inst` installs the files in the user's TeX tree.
  * Running `make install` installs the files in the local TeX tree.

### Manual way

 1. Compile dccpaper.dtx just as you would a normal LaTeX file. Bear in
    mind the documentation requires the Biblatex package and the Biber
    tool rather than regular BibTeX. As well as the usual PDF (or DVI)
    and auxiliary files, several others are generated.
 2. Move the files to your TeX tree as follows:
      - `source/latex/dccpaper`: dccpaper.dtx, dccpaper.ins
      - `tex/latex/dccpaper`: ijdc-v9.cls, idcc.cls, dccpaper-base.sty,
        dccpaper-by.eps, dccpaper-by.pdf
      - `doc/latex/dccpaper`: dccpaper.pdf, dccpaper-apacite.bib,
        dccpaper-biblatex.bib, README.md

 3. You may then have to update your installation's file name database
    before TeX and friends can see the files.
